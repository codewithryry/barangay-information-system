##  About Barangay Information System (BIS)

The **Barangay Information System (BIS)** is a digital solution designed to modernize how barangays operate and engage with the community. Traditionally, many barangays manage data and services manually, making processes time-consuming, prone to error, and difficult to access. BIS addresses these issues by offering a centralized, secure, and user-friendly online platform.

BIS serves multiple roles in the barangay ecosystem:

- **Residents** can register, update personal records, and make service requests.
- **Barangay Officials** can manage resident data, approve requests, and post announcements.
- **SK Officials** have a tailored dashboard for youth-oriented initiatives, events, and resident engagement.
- **Admins** oversee the entire platform, ensuring smooth operations and managing all users.

With BIS, barangays can:
- Improve **transparency** and **efficiency**
- Enhance **community communication**
- Provide **on-demand digital services**
- Reduce **paperwork** and **manual labor**

This system is especially helpful for urbanizing communities aiming to embrace digital governance.
